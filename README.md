# Inclusive-and-Exclusionary-Companies
This will be a list of companies to avoid as well as companies that treat employees well.

Companies will be on the exclusionary list based on records of racism, sexism, xenphobia, transphobia, ableism, colorism, discrimination against pregnant folks, ageism, classism, elitism, fatphobia, islamophiba, anti-semitism, and more as far as bigotry goes. 
Companies will also be exclusionary list based on wage theft, underpaying employees, poor working conditions, donations to hate groups, and other things folks want to avoid.

This list is informal, but will give citations for each of the claims. This will be a combination of objective information (pay gaps, lost to a lawsuit of discrimination, documents of the company being open about discrimination, etc.) as well as the subjective information as well.

This list will also have companies that do not do the above and treat their employees well. It's important to have both as only having a list to avoid does not give a place to actually go to.

Nowhere is perfect, but some places are much better than others. I have always wanted to make this list, but with the tech layoffs in the United States happening, I wanted to make a more formal place to document this.
